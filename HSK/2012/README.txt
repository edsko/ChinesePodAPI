HSK vocabulary lists from http://www.hskhsk.com/word-lists.html

NOTE: The official count for HSK level 2 is 150, while the count in HSK2 is
151; this is because of three differences:

* The official list has two entries for 对 (形容词 and 介词), HSK2 only
  contains one.
* HSK2.txt splits both 虽然……但是…… and 因为……所以…… into two separate entries.
